        <p>
        This Technique of SEO helps the pages of a particular website to rank higher compared to the other sites against a specific keyword.</p>
        <p>
        In SEO we tweak a website to rank at the top in the search engine results pages. The aim is to drive more and more quality traffic.</p>
